    summary:
      "The Design Thinking - Practitioner's Perspective course provides a foundation to aspiring students who want to understand design, innovation by design research and basics of design research that are essential for design consultancy and entrepreneurship. It explores how design thinking flows into iterative, back and forth stages to address the challenges and issues discovered, through a meticulous and empathetic inquiry with the user. The course familiarises students with design lifecycle, user studies, data collection, interpretation and data analysis methods along with creating design solutions, prototyping and evaluation methods and tools. Illustrated case studies, gamified user study techniques and the knowledge gained on sustainable and responsible design give students a broader understanding of the multidisciplinary subject.As per Business Research Insights Report, the Global Design Thinking Market is projected to touch US$14.9 billion by 2032 at CAGR 7.25% during the forecast period 2023-2032.The World Economic Forum ranks problem solving, critical thinking and creativity as the top three skills employees need in order to thrive in the workplace of the future.This course helps students build a foundation in the design thinking process, provides insights into the theories, contexts, principles and methods to understand user experience scenarios and issues. It helps students to systematically investigate, redefine and synthesise a given problem as an opportunity to design, to redefine and to build creative solutions. It also enables students to develop prototypes, evaluate and test solutions, create guidelines and recommendations.",
